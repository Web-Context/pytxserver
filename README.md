## Bottle server

Here is a very simple server to test the [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/) web server :)

Too easy to move to python and [bottle](http://bottlepy.org/), and [textile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/textile) :)

something very usefull: the [pdf](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/bottle-docs.pdf) docs !
